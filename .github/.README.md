# GitHub Actions Configuration

Note: If you are wondering why this README file is named ".github/.README.md", it is becouse having a README in `.github/`
overrides the README.md stored at root of the repo and I don't want that.

This directory contains configurations and scripts for automating workflows using GitHub Actions in the 
**ChessMoveHeatmap** repository. GitHub Actions enables continuous integration (CI), deployment pipelines, 
and other automated tasks to ensure the efficiency, quality, and reliability of the project.

## Structure of the `.github` Directory

### 1. `.github/workflows/`
The `workflows` directory contains YAML files that define GitHub Actions workflows. Each workflow specifies a series of 
automated tasks that are triggered by events such as code pushes, pull requests, or scheduled intervals.

#### Key Features:
- **Event-Based Triggers:** Workflows are triggered by events like `push`, `pull_request`, or custom-defined events.
- **Job Definitions:** Each workflow defines one or more jobs that run on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runners.
- **CI/CD Tasks:** Common tasks include running tests, building the project, deploying code, or generating reports.

#### Example Workflow File:
```yaml
# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests, and lint only changed Python files.
name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    paths: [ '**/*.py' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    paths: [ '**/*.py' ]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: [ "3.7", "3.8", "3.9", "3.10" ]

    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch the entire Git history to ensure all commits are available

      -
        name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      -
        name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install flake8 pytest pylint
          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

      -
        name: Get changed files
        id: get_files
        run: |
          CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.event.after }} | grep '\.py$' || echo "")
          if [ -z "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
            echo "No changed Python files found."
            echo "files=" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          else
            # Convert newline-separated file list to space-separated
            echo "Changed Python files: $CHANGED_FILES"
            echo "files=$(echo $CHANGED_FILES | tr '\n' ' ')" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          fi

      -
        name: Lint only changed Python files with flake8
        if: ${{ env.files && env.files != '' }}
        run: |
          echo "Linting the following changed Python files with flake8:"
          echo "${{ env.files }}"
          flake8 ${{ env.files }} --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
          flake8 ${{ env.files }} --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

      -
        name: Lint only changed Python files with pylint
        if: ${{ env.files && env.files != '' }}
        run: |
          echo "Linting the following changed Python files with pylint:"
          echo "${{ env.files }}"
          pylint ${{ env.files }} --exit-zero

      -
        name: Run affected unit tests
        run: |
          echo "Running the following test files:"
          python .github/scripts/scripts_analyze_dependencies.py "${{ env.files }}" | while read test_file; do
            if [ -f "$test_file" ]; then
              echo "Running $test_file"
              python -m unittest "$test_file"
            else
              echo "Test file $test_file does not exist. Skipping."
            fi
          done
```

### 2. `.github/scripts/`
The `scripts` directory contains custom scripts used within the workflows. These scripts are written in languages like 
Python, Bash, or JavaScript and provide reusable logic to simplify workflows.

#### Purpose:
- **Modularization:** Scripts allow for cleaner and more maintainable workflow files by separating logic.
- **Re-usability:** Shared scripts can be reused across multiple workflows.
- **Flexibility:** Scripts provide the flexibility to implement custom logic not supported natively by GitHub Actions.

#### Example Usage:
A script from `.github/scripts/` can be invoked in a workflow like this:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run scripts_analyze_dependencies script
    run: python .github/scripts/scripts_analyze_dependencies.py "${{ env.files }}"
```

## How This Directory Supports the Project
- **Automation:** Streamlines repetitive tasks like running tests, building the project, or deploying changes.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures code quality through automated testing and linting.
- **Collaboration:** Helps maintain consistency and efficiency in collaborative development efforts.
